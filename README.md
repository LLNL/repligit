# repligit
`repligit` is a python library that implements the git transfer protocol. It
can be used to query remote repos, mirror repos between two locations without storing
state locally, and incrementally archive repositories to disk. `repligit` is used
by [Hubcast](https://github.com/llnl/hubcast) to mirror repositories from GitHub to
GitLab for secure CI/CD on local hardware.
